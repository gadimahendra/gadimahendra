# 👋 Hi, I am Mahendra Gadi

I am a passionate Full Stack Developer who specializes in building modern, responsive web applications. On the frontend, I create intuitive and high-performance user interfaces using **Angular** and **React JS**, along with **RxJS** for reactive programming and **Tailwind CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **Angular Material** for styling and design systems. On the backend, I develop robust and scalable APIs using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, and work with both **MySQL** and **MongoDB** for data management

I thrive in dynamic environments where performance, usability, and collaboration matter. I enjoy taking ownership, solving real-world problems, and contributing to impactful products.
